# Temperature-Converter
This is a temperature converter. It includes 3 inputs for Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin temperature formats.
When we add a value for celsius, we see the equivalent celsius value in Fahrenheit and Kelvin formats.
Similarly, if we change one input, we will see a real-time change inside the other inputs.
I have learnt, how to use the "onchange" event listener to track the changes inside the inputs.
Used switch statement to track changes based on the name of the input we are working on.
Used CSS to give the project a modern look, inspired by newMorphISM design.
